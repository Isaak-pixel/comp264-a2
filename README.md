# MULT213 Assignment 1

## Explore Advanced JavaScript Techniques

### This assignment involved using more advanced JavaScript techniques as well as other skills including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON

The HTML page was to display information from an imported JSON file and output various bits of info regarding it
My choice was the `pokedex.json` file. Some of the information that I displayed included:
- The total amount of Pokemon in the JSON file
- The first and last Pokemon in the JSON file
- Some basic info about each Pokemon including:
  - Name
  - Number
  - Type(s)
  - Image
  - Height
  - Weight
- Averages for some values, skipping over the Pokemon that did not have a calculated value attached to it
- Shortening averages to 2 decimal places to avoid lengthy values
